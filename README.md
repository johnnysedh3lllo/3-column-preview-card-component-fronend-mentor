## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned
this is my first attempt at using CSS Grid in real situation so i would say that grid is quite effective in creating layouts for web components.

### Continued development
i plan to use Grid more to fully understand its capabilities as well venture more into the world of responsive web design.
